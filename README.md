How It Works

This project is a simple example of using JavaScript to change the displayed images on the web page for two players. The setAttribute() method is used to change the src attribute of the image elements, which correspond to different dice faces. When the page is refreshed, random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated for each player, and the corresponding dice face images are displayed.
